# Note:
> Read this file first before starting the development.

1. Install node and npm
2. Install TODO Tree Extension in VS code
3. run "npm i"
4. run "npm run start" to run the server

You can change all html contents as you want but if you want to direct a page just use "/ + filename" instead of using the whole path of the file. Don't worry if it doesn't work. It is just because of backend. 

And if you want to link some css, js and images. Just use

- css/ + filename 
- js/ + filename
- imgs/ + filename

respecitvely

# Good Luck 🍀
